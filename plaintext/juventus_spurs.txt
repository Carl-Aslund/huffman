Few teams leave Juventus' Allianz Stadium with a goal to their name, let alone a draw - and Spurs did it the hard way.

After trailing 2-0 to Gonzalo Higuain's double in the first nine minutes, Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen helped give them the edge on away goals, with Higuain also missing a penalty.

"For 83 minutes we dominated Juventus and that is a thing to praise. Not many teams come here and dominate Juventus," said Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino.

Former England winger Chris Waddle said Spurs were "by far the better side", while ex-Tottenham boss David Pleat predicts a "titanic battle" in the second leg at Wembley on 7 March when a quarter-final place will be at stake.

Juventus were complacent in the first half after going two goals up. It was probably the worst thing that could have happened to them because they sat a little bit and Tottenham had no option but to push on.

As the game developed they made their ascendancy count. Juventus were a little disappointing when you consider their results over the past three months in Italy.

It is quite incredible. They faded in the second half in Cardiff when they played Real Madrid in the final last year, they've got some ageing players in the squad and were missing some players.

They may well have players back, including Paulo Dybala, for the second game. And they've had a good look at Tottenham now so they know what they are up against. This will be a titanic battle.
